                <h3> Intern, Summer 2022 <br> Consultant, Feb 2023 - Present</h3>

                <p> I was brought on to the growing <strong> Data and Analytics </strong> team at FTI Consulting, primarily focusing on the implementation of advanced data and analytics in litigation matters. 
                    Previously I worked on NLP models combined with automated web-scraping to process and faciliate insights on financial institutions data. 
                    Currently, I work on a high-profile anti-money laundering matter involving mass data processing, cleaning, quality control, and expert analysis that involves a strong 
                    understanding of international financial data regulation across over 100 countries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recently, I was an inaguaral member of FTI's new <strong>TDAS (Technology Dispute and Advisory Services Group). </strong> 
                    In this group, I have focused on expert report writing on intellectual property matters specifically in the field of patent law and derivations.

                <h3> Jan 2022- May 2023</h3>

                <p> In my last few semesters at Cornell, I joined Joy Ming and Professor Vashistha's NSF funded research project surrounding the use and impacts of technology on wage 
                    theft in low wage workers, primarily in the homecare work field. We explored how technology could be designed to address questions of visibility 
                    through design provocations and focus groups with workers and worker advocates.
